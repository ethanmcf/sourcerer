Kivy python application that allows you to paste in your essay or written document and reformat it with correct citations. The document must contain a refernce list with links as well as intext citations marked by '(cite1)'.

The sourcer will scrape each website and properly create either an APA or MLA intext and final reference citation which will replace all the links intext citations so you can just copy your document fully formatted and cited.
